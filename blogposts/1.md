# How I built this site

Have you ever scrolled through social media and stumbled upon something that ignites a creative spark? That's exactly what happened to me recently. I was browsing through YouTube when I saw a video post by a developer showcasing his stunning portfolio website, built with Tailwind CSS and Next.js. The clean design, smooth animations, and overall responsiveness left me mesmerized.

<img
                            className="w-[48rem] max-w-none rounded-xl bg-gray-900 shadow-xl ring-1 ring-gray-400/10 sm:w-[57rem]"
                            src="https://tailwindui.com/img/component-images/dark-project-app-screenshot.png"
                            alt=""
                        />

In that moment, a realization dawned on me: I needed a portfolio to showcase my own skills! But where to begin? The developer's post mentioned these cool technologies, **Tailwind CSS** (a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to build custom designs without leaving HTML) and **Next.js** (a React framework that enables server-side rendering, making your site faster and more SEO-friendly).

I decided to give it a try.

- **Taking the First Step: Embracing Modularity.**
  Instead of feeling overwhelmed, I decided to break things down. I knew a single-page portfolio would be a great starting point, and that's where the concept of modularity came in. I envisioned the site as a collection of reusable components, each representing a section like "About Me," "Skills," or "Blog." This way, I could focus on building and perfecting each component independently, and incrementally following the CI/CD principle.

- **A Step-by-Step Build**
  1. **Setting Up:** I started by creating a new Next.js project using the command line. This gave me the basic file structure and functionalities for building a React application as well as installing the required dependencies including Tailwind CSS and TypeScript (optionally). Then made my initial commit to GitHub (a version control system).
  
  2. **Building components:** One by one, I built the components for each section of the portfolio, committing changes to GitHub as I went along. Each component had its own JavaScript (.js) exported function and in-line CSS styling with Tailwind classes. To view my changes in real-time, I had a live server running on a secondary display which enabled rapid design iterations.
  
  3. **Responsiveness:** To ensure the site looked good on any device, I used Tailwind's responsive utilities extensively. Adding classes like `md:hidden` or `lg:flex` allowed me to control how elements appeared on different screen sizes (i.e., on a mobile phone or a desktop).
  
  4. **Future extensions:** The process of building this portfolio is not simply about the website itself; it is a journey of learning and exploration. Tailwind CSS makes styling a breeze, and Next.js provided a solid foundation for building a modern React application. The final product will be a single-page portfolio that showcases my skills and projects in a visually appealing and responsive way. More importantly, it will serve as a testament to the power of starting small, embracing modularity, and taking inspiration from others.
